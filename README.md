# AWS-Snowflake-Tableau-Project

# Energy Consumption Dashboard

The project began with setting up an Amazon S3 bucket where the raw data was loaded and securely stored. A dedicated IAM role was then created to manage access, followed by setting up a Snowflake integration object and updating the trust policy to authorize secure data transfers. Once these connections were established, the dataset was ingested into Snowflake for processing. A thorough data understanding phase was carried out to explore the structure and quality of the data. This was followed by several transformation steps using Snowflake SQL to clean, restructure, and prepare the dataset for analysis. After the data was properly structured, it was connected to Tableau for visualization. The first set of visualizations focused on monthly energy usage consumption across countries, regions, and energy sources. Additional charts were developed to track and compare cost savings (CSU), providing insight into economic efficiency by location and source. All of these elements were then brought together into a comprehensive dashboard titled Energy Consumption Dashboard, which offers clear, comparative visuals like “KWH by Country,” “CSU by Country,” and segmented views by region and energy source. Finally, the dashboard was published to Tableau Cloud, making it accessible for online collaboration and stakeholder engagement.
